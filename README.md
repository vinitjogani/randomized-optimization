# Randomized Optimization

To run discrete optimization tuning experiments, simply run `python discrete_xperiments.py`. To generate the final comparative curves, run `python discrete_best.py`. For continuous optimization experiments, run `python continuous_experiments.py`.

All the algorithms are implemented in `algorithms.py`, and the problemes are in `problems.py`. There are helper methods to work with bitstrings in `bitstrings.py` and to load the term deposits dataset in `datasets.py`.

All charts and models will be generated in `readings/` and `neuralnets/` respectively.
